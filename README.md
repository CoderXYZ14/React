# React Learning Journey by Shahwaiz Islam

## Overview

Welcome to my React Learning Journey! This repository captures the essence of my 7-day learning adventure with React. In the span of 6 days, I delved into the core concepts of React, and on the 7th day, I explored Material-UI. This project aims to serve as a learning resource for others interested in React development.

## Getting Started

To explore the code and follow my React learning journey, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CoderXYZ14/React.git
